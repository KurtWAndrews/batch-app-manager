The SAS Application Management System will allow developers and managers maintain data about developers, projects, teams, 
programs that will be used to configure paging, notification, and environment defaults for applications running in A SAS 
environment.  The data also keeps track of processes during execution. The data captured includes the start and end times 
of the process as well as the process status during execution.  SAMS does not create this process data, but SAMS should 
provide an interface for viewing and querying the data.
